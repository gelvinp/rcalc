# Track 1
 - Add sqlite module (enabled by platforms, have a built in preferences system) (maybe?)
 - Create options controller, platform integration with data directory, save/load interface
 - Create lib target
 - Create TUI renderer

# Track 2
 - Improve help page for imgui renderer

# Track 3
 - Expose base unit types and all units, to help page

# Track 4
 - RefCounted Value
 - Format function returns a StackFormatNode* (Each node contains a variant<const char*, Ref<Value>, StackFormatNode*, ColVector> and a next pointer) (linked lists babeyyyyy)
 - Templated Vector display wrapper type (ColVector) that stores a Ref<Value>, and indicates it should be displayed as a column vector
    - Tie into mul and div format functions, if arg0.is_mat() and arg1.is_vec() (will need to make those functions first but ez)
 - flatten() function that returns a vector of variant<const char*, Ref<Value>, ColVector> (flattens the recursive nodes [carefully])
 - Matrix to_string should use newlines and ensure consistent spacing
 - ImGuiRenderer should layout lines in these chunks, keeping track of total entry height across multiple lines, it'll be a mess ~~i'm so excited~~
