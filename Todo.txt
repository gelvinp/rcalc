# Track 1
 - Add sqlite module (enabled by platforms, have a built in preferences system) (maybe?)
 - Create options controller, platform integration with data directory, save/load interface
 - Create lib target
 - Create TUI renderer

# Track 2
 - Format function returns a StackFormatNode* (Each node contains a variant<const char*, Ref<Value>, StackFormatNode*, ColVector> and a next pointer) (linked lists babeyyyyy)
 - Templated Vector display wrapper type (ColVector) that stores a Ref<Value>, and indicates it should be displayed as a column vector
    - Tie into mul and div format functions, if arg0.is_mat() and arg1.is_vec() (will need to make those functions first but ez)
 - Matrix to_string should use newlines and ensure consistent spacing
 - ImGuiRenderer should layout lines in these chunks, keeping track of total entry height across multiple lines, it'll be a mess ~~i'm so excited~~
 - Do something better with displaying binary, octal, and hex values

# Track 3
 - Implement arena allocator (PMR?) for Value vectors and Displayable
